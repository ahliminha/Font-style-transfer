# Font-style-transfer
This project intends to transfer a chinese font style to another alphabet in an usual ocidental font. This was a school work in State University of Campinas (UNICAMP). 
The notebooks ware made such way that we could change the hyperparameters and we could test a lot of nexperiments in a controlled way. The net was trained in the chinese alphabet and the objective is to rewrite the ocidental alphabet with the style of the chinese alphabet.
The best results were with the EXP12 settings, and after the images were binarized, intending to reduce the blur of the image.
